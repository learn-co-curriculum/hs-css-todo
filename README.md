You will be coding your solutions in both `garden.css` and `garden.html`

Our garden is getting a little unruly. We need to really put in some work to put our vegetables in even rows and even sized patches.

We are currently growing six different vegetables. You task is to take all 6 and put them in even rows with 2 vegetables each. You should make sure and alot an equal amount of space for each type of vegetable.

Along with putting the vegetables in even rows, you will also want to add markers to each vegetable so everyone knows what types you're growing. 

Feel free to add additional styling to make the header look good and change the background.
